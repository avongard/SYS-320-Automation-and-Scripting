3. Based on the usernames of those who connected to the SSH you can tell that they are all by the same person. Not only
    can we tell this based on the IP addresses that connected but also due to the fact that there were never two users
    holding an SSH session at the same time. Another indicator of this is the connect , followed by a disconnect, then
    a new connect from another user through SSH.

4. What I liked most about the lab was the videos used to follow along. It really helped me gauge what part I was at and
    how to troubleshoot certain mistakes I was making such as using something as simple as "print(x)" when i'm not
    getting the output that i'm looking for.

5. No additional questions.
