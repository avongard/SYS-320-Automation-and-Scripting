Do you see anything of concern with the attempts to obtain a shell?  Provide a brief explanation.
--
One issue that I can see being a potential problem for obtaining a shell is that once the shell is compromised so is the
rest of the system. It's probably no coincidence that the shell attack was the first one on the playbook.

What did you like the most and least about this assignment?
--
Most - Creating a function of code that is useful and good for reference.
Least - Testing.

What additional questions do you have?
--
No additional questions but I would like to brush up on using the parser + a yml file without having to use the console
or select individual files. The biggest area of problems for me are having to decipher which functions we worked on prev-
iously and which ones would apply best for this assignment.
