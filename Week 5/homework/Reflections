1.  Did not manage to complete the code and produce an output
    Things to continue working on:
    1. Formatting the output that gets printed to the user.
    2. How exactly the toolkit gets matched
    3. Code to link functions and complete the .py file

2.  What I liked the most about the assignment was the different use of a YAML file
    it feels a lot more flexible being able to have multiple utilities for a term such
    as using one of the links or references.

3. Are assignments given a "0%" that do not output the code despite meeting parts of the grading criteria?
