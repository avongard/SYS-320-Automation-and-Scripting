Reflections

1. The conclusion about the host analyzed is that there is a malicious user who can be seen in the auth.log and passwd
file as being detected on the server. After analyzing the pid # and suspicious files found with kraken the information
gathered from the threat hunt can confirm.

2. What I liked the most about the assignment was the numerous tasks to complete and how they covered different aspects
of our sftp and ssh knowledge to execute commands and fetch files.

What I liked least about the assignment was no fault to the assignment but instead on myself for not taking sufficient
time to write, test, and execute the code.

3. Is there a cyber.local vpn or way to connect from the remote portal?
