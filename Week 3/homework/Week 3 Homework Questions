1. https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html

2. The csv.writer function below is an example of how a writer might interpret the file and specify things such as the
   delimiter value in the instance it's not a comma.

csv.writer(f, delimiter =' ',quotechar =',')

3. Python utilizes dialects and specifically the qutochar shown above to decipher if the value is part of the data or
   a delimiter.

4. A heredoc is useful for multi line strings that need to be read by the parser is a way that isn't on one line and
   can read all these characters including the new line seperating them.

5. What I liked most about the homework was the goal of it to better our skills of writing and reading code so that can
   not only find the mistakes in flawed code but also our own code and where we might run into some common issues.
   I did not dislike the assignment and thought it was fair to give a smaller classwork assignment due to the amount of
   time it took me to get a working set of code.
